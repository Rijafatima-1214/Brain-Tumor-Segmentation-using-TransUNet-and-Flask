# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-using-TransUNet-and-Flask
This project implements brain tumor segmentation using TransUNet, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model, trained on the BraTS 2023 dataset. It preprocesses multimodal MRI scans, evaluates with Dice and IoU scores, and provides a Flask-based web app for visualizing input, ground truth, and predicted segmentation masks.
